## Summary

Convo centered on tech and language nerdery, starting with a quick aside about constructed languages before diving deep into AI-powered image editing. Michael and Ryan explored how LLMs leverage traditional image tools for face swaps and text editing, with Michael determined to solve text manipulation without waiting for big vendors.

### Constructed Language Musings

 Luca briefly noted that Klingon is a fully constructed language, highlighting that all languages are essentially invented even if most evolve slowly over centuries. The remark framed languages as designed systems rather than organic inevitabilities.

### LLM-Driven Image and Text Editing

 Ryan explained that systems like nanobanana work by having an LLM orchestrate classical masking and inpainting techniques, suggesting competitors can replicate the approach. Michael is focused on solving the persistent challenge of editing embedded text in generated images, experimenting with legacy text-detection tools to make text editable and aiming to understand Canva’s solution rather than waiting for a major vendor’s eventual fix. Ryan added that similar principles apply to coding, where LLMs enhance existing paradigms until a fundamental shift occurs.
