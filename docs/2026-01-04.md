### Upcoming ESP32 Hardware Classes

 Stewart announced that six ESP32 boards have been ordered so the group can begin its first hardware-focused class. Because these sessions require physical devices connected to each participant’s computer, they will be in-person only, offered about one to two times per month while software classes continue with both in-person and remote formats. Ali asked if classes could be filmed for later viewing, and Stewart clarified that anyone who purchases their own ESP32 kit could follow along remotely, calling that an elegant solution.

Stewart responded that one of the referenced items was mind-blowing, showing enthusiasm for the shared content.
