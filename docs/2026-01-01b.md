## Summary

The group traded progress updates and tooling tips before diving into an extended debate over randomness in AI systems. Ryan shared build progress and local LLM resources, while Michael led a string of probabilistic experiments that sparked philosophical bets about true randomness and space-based entropy sources.

## Topics


### Supabase Tracker Build Progress

 Ryan reported that he has created a Supabase-powered daily spend and food tracker, noting that the page layout came from Google Stitch and has already been translated into working code, earning a light-hearted reaction from Melissa.

### Plan Mode for Product Scoping

 Jason encouraged everyone to try the tool’s “plan” mode as a way to refine product scopes, describing it as an easier-than-expected setup that elevates prompt engineering. Ryan joked that he was merely babysitting while watching Jason’s presentation, signaling interest in the workflow being showcased.

### n8n Automation Bug Fix

 DB Bellot reported resolving a known bug in n8n version 2.1.4 by downgrading the container to 1.76.0, which restored functionality and prompted a celebratory note, effectively closing the incident for the team.

### Local LLM Tools and Infrastructure

 Ryan circulated multiple video links and mentioned installing ComfyUI to access a range of free local AI tools, while Daniel warned that such setups often hit RAM limits. Stewart contributed a curated GitHub list of over 100 open-source, self-hostable LLM services, framing the discussion around ambitions for robust local deployments.

### Randomness Experiments and Debate

 Michael ran a series of tests through an AI tool to observe its quasi-random behavior, sharing frequency counts for outputs under different prompts and culminating in a dramatic single-word challenge. Ryan argued that computing lacks true randomness, sparking Stewart’s defense of space-based entropy sources, Erik’s reference to hardware RNGs, DB’s note on cosmic ray flux patterns, and playful banter from Harry. The exchange ended with a tongue-in-cheek million-credit bet between Ryan and Michael over whether AI will eventually crack allegedly true random generators.
