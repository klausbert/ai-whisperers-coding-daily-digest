## Summary

The group spent the day in a deep philosophical and technical debate about encryption, quantum computing, and the nature of randomness. Conversation drifted from practical security concerns—like whether quantum machines could crack systems such as ithy or Cloudflare’s lava-lamp randomness—to broader questions about determinism, death, and the limits of prediction.

### Quantum Security and Randomness Debate

 Ali sparked the discussion by asking about ithy’s coding strength and whether quantum computers could eventually break encryption schemes, even those seeded with highly random sources such as Cloudflare’s lava lamps. Diego countered that quantum computers are not omniscient and distinguished between true randomness and deterministic predictability, while Ryan highlighted the long-term horizon (a 1,000-year bet) and the role of quantum randomness already embedded in technologies like EUV lithography. Stewart and Ali steered the conversation toward philosophical territory—questioning the randomness of death and whether lifestyle choices can delay it—while Michael asked how such claims could be empirically tested. The debate ultimately broadened into the limits of human knowledge and whether the universe is deterministic, with participants acknowledging that even perfect prediction might be unknowable from within the system.
