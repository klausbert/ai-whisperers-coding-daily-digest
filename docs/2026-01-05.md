## Summary

The chat centered on evaluating why Claude Code currently feels more capable than competing AI coding tools, with participants dissecting the importance of product harnesses over raw model power. Later the conversation shifted to a hands-on tangent about building a drone, sparking interest in learning and sharing the process once someone gains experience.

### Claude Code vs. Gemini Harness Design

 Stewart Alsop asked why Claude Code seems to outperform OpenAI and Gemini offerings despite Gemini’s superior compute. Philip Galebach argued that the decisive factor is the surrounding harness: Claude’s ability to navigate file systems, provide efficient command automation, capture user intent over time, and remain user-friendly makes it far more usable. He pointed out that its prompts and tools are public, making it easier to study and replicate. Erik Kahler added that Claude’s focus on interleaved thinking enables better real-time collaboration for messy, iterative development work, whereas other high-scoring models prioritize long-form reasoning in more controlled settings.

### DIY Drone Project

 Federico Lois shared plans to build a drone with his child using ESP32 chips, prompting enthusiasm from others. Stewart Alsop asked him to teach the group once he figures it out, while Ryan and Mauri contributed related links for inspiration. Federico modestly replied that he needs to succeed with his own build first before teaching anyone else.
